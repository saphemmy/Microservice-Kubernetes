## How to Generate a Personal Access Token
- Go to GitHub, and make sure you are logged in.

- Click your user image at the top right, and select settings

- On the Left hand side, there is a long list of options, find and select developer settings

- Click personal access tokens. Then select Tokens (classic).

- Click Generate new token, then Generate new token (classic).

- Add a note (eg "jenkins access"). This will be useful in the future so you can see what each token is for

- Set an expiration - you can make it "no expiration" but GitHub will disapprove of this! As long as the token lasts for as long as you're following the course all will be well.

- Under "Select Scopes", click on "repo" which should add several priviledges

- Also,  further down the list, click on admin:org_hook
At the bottom, click generate token.

- Now you will be given a long string - copy this onto clipboard as you will need this a few times through this video. You can't get the token again on the github site (once you've left the page) - if you lose the token, no problem - just make a new one.

- I recommend you paste the token into a text editor so that you can access later on in the videos, but for safety it is probably best not to save the file - just leave it open and unsaved.
